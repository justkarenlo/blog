## "Take a Leap of Faith"

I really had meant to blog a bit more than just the... two... posts I have up right now. Goodness. Right now there are these thoughts running through my head.

"Shame on you for not blogging more." "Why bother blogging anyways, no one's reading!" "Superego, you need the shut the f*** up." "Wow, I can't believe you just sensored yourself on your own blog."

So suffice to say, even after 3 months out of DBC, it's still been a constant struggle fighting off my superego. And after all this job hunting, the superego 'voice' seems to have increased in volume, leading to the lack of my presence on this blog.

If you are like me, someone who is currently enduring a long job hunt process and are perhaps feeling a bit alone and like you are plummeting into a dark abyss, just know that I am right there with you! Yes, plummeting into that dark abyss alongside you. Except the dark abyss is really just a dark room, and the plummeting feeling is really just the distance of falling off a chair. So really one of us just needs to turn on the light switch. So here I am turning on a light switch.

Job hunting sucks. Job hunting can make you drag your feet everyday. Job hunting can make you disheartened. But job hunting is not your life. It is not a career; it's just a means to an end. So don't forget that during this process, you still make time for YOU, make time for exercise (which is essentially still YOU time), and make time for, you know, that thing you used to enjoy before you were job hunting. Oh, I don't know. What was it called? Oh yeah, that's right. Programming.

Remember to take a leap of faith that with perseverance and optimism you'll find yourself exactly where you want to be.

Oh, and above all else, make time to tell your superego to STFU.

Stay Strong. Peace.
