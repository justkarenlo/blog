## This is Finally Happening!

I have been itching to get back into blogging and now I am finally making it happen. Loads have happened since my last official post back in Blog 1.0. Graduated DBC feeling confident and assured, and here I am almost 2 months out and I'm struggling. Little did I know that not only will I always have plenty to learn and research, that if I don't consistently push myself, I can easily forget the things I worked so very hard on. And that is my message to you, don't slack, find a passion project. Heck, find many passion projects. And... apply to jobs as fast as you can, but keep brushing up on what you know, keep looking to online courses to help you fill in those gaps, and keep on coding like your life depended on it.

I don't have a vision for what this blog will essentially be, as my last one was very much DBC driven, I have free reign as to what this will be like. And I'm thinking, why not another one of those blogs that just talks about the trials and tribulations of coding, job hunting, and in general the day in a life of a junior web developer? So here goes, and thanks for joining me on my journey folks :)
