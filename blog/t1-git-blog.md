The one with the first post
    ...where it all starts
9/18/2014 = Phase 0 Week 1

This should be interesting. I'm writing my first blog through Sublime. Ever heard of that? 'Cause prior to a few months ago, I had no idea what that was either. Well if you're anything like me and the other [enter outrageous number here] people, you'll definitely cozy right up to it as a coder. And for those of you who are in the know, Dev Boot Camp encourages us to blog about our experiences, knowledge, and struggles so that we can not only better our own learning experience, but also help someone else out. SOOO... yeah, there are a lot of these blogs out there. The best I can provide you is my perspective, personality, and "know-how". Let's see how that works out!

"Know-How"

        VERSION CONTROL = LORTNOC NOISREV
  Any way you spin it, it's pretty self explanatory. When we code we go through a long process and during this process we have multiple 'saves' in case we screw up later on and need a 'backed up' file. This is version control and now you can see how imperative that this becomes a common practice when we code.

  We keep several versions of our code so that we have the control to go back in time as we see fit. There are these two programs we work with heavily to complete version control: git and GitHub. Git is this handy little program in our system we can access through a nifty tool called Terminal(for MAC). GitHub is an external website that can host files.
      Git is able to execute version control via various commands. It allows you to keep track of changes that occur in your git files, stage them, and commit them. Once completed you can push your update onto a repository you may have on your GitHub. If you ever have to go back to an old "commit," you merely only need to search through the git logs for a sequence and pull that information back.

  Why GitHub?
      This website works seamlessly with git to sync your files as you see fit. In addition, GitHub is one of the best sites for sharing coding and projects. Not only can you find other coders' work and use/manipulate it, others can do the same with yours. This type of community really allows a freeflow of knowledge and cuts out all of the unnecessary competitive nature some might develop.

  Well that's about it for my first post. I hope you enjoyed it, 'cause it certainly will not be the last!
